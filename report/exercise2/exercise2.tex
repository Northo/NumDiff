\section{Heat equation in one dimension}
In this section, we consider the one-dimensional heat equation for $u = u(x, t)$, 
\begin{equation*}
    u_t = u_{xx}, \quad u(x, 0) = f(x), \quad x \in [0,1] := \Omega, 
    \label{eq:heat-eq}
\end{equation*}
with either Neumann or Dirchelet boundaryconditions, 
and solve it numerically using both the Backward Euler method and Crank-Nicolson method. 
These are $\mathcal{O}(k+h^2)$ and $\mathcal{O}(k^2+h^2)$ methods respectively, 
and we will analyze and compare their convergence using mesh refinement as we did in section \ref{task_1}. However we will here restrict our attention to uniform grids only. 

\subsection{Numerical solution method}
To solve the heat equation numerically we first perform semi-discretization, 
i.e. we do spatial discretization and keep the time continous. 
The interval $\Omega$ is divided into $M$Â equidistant points with separation $h=1/(M-1)$, 
as described in section \ref{task_1}, 
and we express the spatial derivative using the central finite difference to get %Maybe reference the equation for central diff in section 1?
\begin{equation*}
    u_t(x_m, t) = \frac{1}{h^2} \delta_x^2 u(x_m, t) + \mathcal{O}(h^2), 
    \quad m = 1,...,M.
\end{equation*}
We now introduce the single variate functions $v_m(t)$ as the approximation to $u(x_m, t)$, 
at each $x_m$, 
turning the PDE into a set of ODEs 
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{dv_m(t)}{dt} = \frac{1}{h^2} \delta_x^2 v_m(t), 
    \quad v_m(0) = f(x_m). 
\end{equation*}

The problem is then generally solved by imposing the boundary conditions, 
and numerically integrating the equations in time. 
The integration can be done by using one of the many off-shelf routines for ODEs, 
e.g. Euler's method,  
and for convenience we employ the $\theta$-method, 
which for general ODEs $y' = g(y, t)$ is given as
\begin{equation*}
    y^{n+1} = y^n + \Delta t ((1-\theta)g(y^n, t_n)+\theta g(y^{n+1}, t_{n+1})). 
\end{equation*}
Using a constant time step $\Delta t = k$ leads to uniform discretization of the time interval, 
which we divide into $N$ equidistant points, 
and the final discrete grid for space and time is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:2-uniform-grid}.
This gives the approximate solution of $v_m(t)$ at $N$ finite times $t_n = nk, \quad n = 1, \ldots N$, 
\quad $k = 1/(N-1)$, 
and we finally denote the fully discretized approximation of $u(x_m, t_n)$ as $U_{m}^{n}$. 
The $\theta$-method for the 1D heat equation is then written out as
\begin{equation}
    theta method for heat equation, 
    \label{eq:theta-heat}
\end{equation}
and setting the value of $\theta$ in \eqref{eq:theta-heat} determines the specific numerical scheme. 
We have
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
    \text{Forward Euler} \quad \theta = 0 \\
    \text{Backward Euler} \quad \theta = 1 \\
    \text{Crank-Nicolson} \quad \theta = \frac{1}{2}, \\
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
and we will as mentioned consider the Bacward-Euler and Crank-Nicolson methods.

    \caption{Discrete uniform grid}
    \label{fig:2-uniform-grid}
\end{figure}

Imposing boundary conditions and some matrix form/equations here I guess.

With the numerical schemes in hand we now solve the heat equation with the following Neumann boundary conditions and initial condition, 
\begin{equation}
    u_x(0,t) = u_x(1,t) = 0, \quad u(x,0) = 2\pi x - \sin(2\pi x). 
    \label{eq:2a}
\end{equation}
The computed solutions for $t \in [0, 0.5]$ is plotted in figure \ref{fig:2a-surface}, 
and qualitatively the solution behaves in accordance to what one should expect for the heat equation. 
To quantify and compare the accuracy of the numerical schemes we will now proceed to analyze convergence using mesh refinement, 
similar to what we did in section \ref{task_1}. 

\begin{figure}[ht]

    \input{exercise2/2a_surface_plot.pgf}
    \caption{I am a surface plot, Hooray :)}
    \label{fig:2a-surface}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Convergence and mesh refinement}
For \eqref{eq:2a}, the the analytical solution is not available in closed form, 
so in order to analyze convergence we compute a reference solution using a sufficiently high $M$, 
which we use in place of the analytical solution when computing the error. 

In order to analyze the convergence further, 
we also consider the heat equation with a set of boundary and initial conditions for which the analytical solution is known. 
Specifically we consider 
\begin{equation}
    u(0,t) = u(1,t) = 0, \quad u(x,0) = \sin(\pi x), 
    \label{eq:2b-manufactured}
\end{equation}
on the same domain $x \in [0,1] := \Omega$ and $t > 0$. 
Note that we now have Dirchlet boundary conditions, 
and the analytical solution is readily available as 
\footnote{The analytical solution can be computed using e.g. separation of variables.}
\begin{equation}
    u(x,t) = \sin(\pi x)  e^{- \pi^2 t}.
    % Necessary to derive this? Just separation of variables,
    % and it is like the most basic example of the heat equation, 
    % probably included in any introductory text on PDEs
\end{equation}

When doing mesh refinement of the spatial grid, 
we vary the number of spatial grid points $M$, 
and compute the numerical solution at the same point in time $t=t_{end}$. 
The number of time steps $N$ is kept fixed, 
and compute both the $L_2$ discrete relative error. 
For equation \eqref{eq:2b-manufactured} we also compute the $l_2$ continous relative error, 
and the resulting convergence plots are shown in figure \ref{fig:2a-convergence} and \ref{fig:2b-convergence}. 

Both methods are second order in the spatial step $h$, 
but Crank-Nicolson is one order higher in time step $k$.

\section{Invicid Burgers' equation}

In this section we briefly inspect and solve the inviscid Burgers' equation, 
and evaluate the breaking which this equation exhibits. 

Notes:
    -Also semi-discretization, but integrate using off-shelf routine
    -Breaking/shock formation: Numerical vs theoretical
