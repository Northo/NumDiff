\section{Heat equation in one dimension}
In this section, we consider the one-dimensional heat equation, 
and solve it numerically using both the Backward Euler method and Crank-Nicolson method. 
These are $\mathcal{O}(k+h^2)$ and $\mathcal{O}(k^2+h^2)$ methods respectively, 
and we will analyze and compare the convergence of the two methods using mesh refinement as we did in section \ref{task_1}. 

We start by considering the heat equation with the following Neumann boundary conditions and initial condition, 
\begin{equation*}
    u_t = u_{xx}, \quad u_x(0,t) = u_x(1,t) = 0, \quad u(x,0) = 2\pi x - \sin(2\pi x),
    \label{eq:2a}
\end{equation*}
valid for $x \in [0,1] := \Omega$ and $t > 0$.
The equation can be solved numeriacally by dividing the interval $\Omega$ in $M$Â discrete points, 
as described in section \ref{task_1}.
We also discretize the time interval $t \in [0,t_{end}]$ in the same way, so that we approximate the solution at $N$ finite times $t_n = nk, \quad n = 1, \ldots N$.

Q: Should we explain the BE and CN (ev. the $\theta$-method, or does it suffice to referece them?

For \eqref{eq:2a}, the the analytical solution is not available in closed form, 
so in order to analyze convergence we compute a reference solution using a sufficiently high $M$, 
which we use in place of the analytical solution when computing the error.

\end{figure}

In order to analyze the convergence further, 
we now consider the heat equation with a set of boundary and initial conditions for which the analytical solution is known. 
Specifically we consider 
\begin{equation}
    u_t = u_{xx}, \quad u(0,t) = u(1,t) = 0, \quad u(x,0) = \sin(\pi x), 
\end{equation}
on the same domain $x \in [0,1] := \Omega$ and $t > 0$. 
Note that we now have Dirchlet boundary conditions, 
and the analytical solution is readily available as
\begin{equation}
    u(x,t) = \sin(\pi x)  e^{- \pi^2 t}.
\end{equation}
