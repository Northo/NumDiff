	abstract = {Matrix Analysis for Scientists and Engineers provides a blend of undergraduate- and graduate-level topics in matrix theory and linear algebra that relieves instructors of the burden of reviewing such material in subsequent courses that depend heavily on the language of matrices. Consequently, the text provides an often-needed bridge between undergraduate-level matrix theory and linear algebra and the level of matrix analysis required for graduate-level study and research. The text is sufficiently compact that the material can be taught comfortably in a one-quarter or one-semester course. Throughout the book, the author emphasizes the concept of matrix factorization to provide a foundation for a later course in numerical linear algebra. The author addresses connections to differential and difference equations as well as to linear system theory and encourages instructors to augment these examples with other applications of their own choosing.},

This property is in the first part of the paper used to investigate the sensitivity of the spectrum. Explicit expressions for the structured distance to the closest normal matrix, the departure from normality, and the ϵ-pseudospectrum are derived. The second part of the paper discusses applications of the theory to inverse eigenvalue problems, the construction of Chebyshev polynomial-based Krylov subspace bases, and Tikhonov regularization.
